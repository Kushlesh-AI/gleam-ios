## About Gleam

Skin cancer is in third place in terms of the incidence of oncology detection in Russian men and second in women. The five-year threshold is experienced by only half of the patients. Even with the second stage of melanoma and with proper treatment. Therefore, an early production diagnosis is practically the only way to get a favorable prognosis for treatment. The solution could be a mobile application, with which you can make an early diagnosis and promptly seek treatment.
